    "## Purpose of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have completed conformer generation, we wish to analyze the activity of the building blocks in each position. The activity of each building block is defined by a \"P(active)\" value, which is just a ratio of the number of times a building block occurs in active compounds compared to all compounds. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(active) = \\frac{n_{active}}{n_{active} + n_{inactive}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With sufficient number of observations, this metric should be quite robust. The analysis notebooks provide more intuition for the metric and demonstrate its value.\n",

    "Input:\n",
    "- `total_compounds.csv`: list of all compounds that made it through the data cleaning procedure\n",
    "- `bb1_info_row.csv`: SMILES of building blocks in position 1 that made it through conformer generation\n",
    "- `bb2_info_row.csv`: SMILES of building blocks in position 2 that made it through conformer generation\n",
    "- `bb3_info_row.csv`: SMILES of building blocks in position 3 that made it through conformer generation\n",

    "(if matrix is not symmetric, will also need to load in `*info_col.csv` files too)\n",
